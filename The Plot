The Plot
To make his horror perfect, Caesar, hemmed
about at the foot of a statue by his friends'
impatient knives, discovers among the faces
and the blades the face of Marcus Junius
Brutus, his ward, perhaps his very son—and so
Caesar stops defending himself, and cries out Et
tu, Brute? Shakespeare and Quevedo record
that pathetic cry.
Fate is partial to repetitions, variations,
symmetries. Nineteen centuries later, in the
southern part of the province of Buenos Aires, a 
gaucho is set upon by other gauchos, and as he
falls he recognizes a godson of his, and says to
him in gentle remonstrance and slow surprise
(these words must be heard, not read): Pero,
¡che! Heches, but he does not know that he has
died so that a scene can be played out again.
