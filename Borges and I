Borges And I
It's Borges, the other one, that things happen
to. I walk through Buenos Aires and I pause—
mechanically now, perhaps—to gaze at the arch
of an entryway and its inner door; news of
Borges reaches me by mail, or I see his name on
a list of academics or in some biographical
dictionary. My taste runs to hourglasses, maps,
seventeenth-century typefaces, etymologies, the
taste of coffee, and the prose of Robert Louis 
Stevenson; Borges shares those preferences, but
in a vain sort of way that turns them into the
accoutrements of an actor. It would be an
exaggeration to say that our relationship is
hostile—I live, I allow myself to live, so that
Borges can spin out his literature, and that
literature is my justification. I willingly admit
that he has written a number of sound pages,
but those pages will not save me, perhaps
because the good in them no longer belongs to
any individual, not even to that other man, but
rather to language itself, or to tradition.
Beyond that, I am doomed—utterly and
inevitably—to oblivion, and fleeting moments
will be all of me that survives in that other man.
Little by little, I have been turning everything
over to him, though I know the perverse way he
has of distorting and magnifying everything.
Spinoza believed that all things wish to go on
being what they are—stone wishes eternally to
be stone, and tiger, to be tiger. I shall endure in
Borges, not in myself (if, indeed, I am anybody
at all), but I recognize myself less in his books
than in many others', or in the tedious
strumming of a guitar. Years ago I tried to free
myself from him, and I moved on from the
mythologies of the slums and outskirts of the
city to games with time and infinity, but those
games belong to Borges now, and I shall have to
think up other things. So my life is a pointcounterpoint, a kind of fugue, and a falling
away—and everything winds up being lost to
me, and everything falls into oblivion, or into
the hands of the other man.
I am not sure which of us it is that's writing
